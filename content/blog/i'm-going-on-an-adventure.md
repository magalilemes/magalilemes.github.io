# whoami

My name is Magali, I'm a second-year Computer Science student, living in São
Paulo. Before that, I was a Materials Engineering major but then realised
that wasn't really my thing. The decision to switch majors was hugely
influenced by an 'Intro to Computer Science' class that I took in my first
semester.

In my free time, I am generally watching series or listening to
music while surfing the web. On vacation, though, I like to
discover new places and be a tourist.
   
For the next three months, I'm going to be a GNU Guix intern in Outreachy,
and every two weeks, I'll describe here how the development of this project
is going.

# Core Values

There are two core values I believe are fundamental to accomplish goals in
life: responsibility and willingness to keep learning.

## Responsibility

If you want to get things done, you've got to be organized and take things
seriously, setting goals and being transparent to yourself about how your
progress is going. This is one of the many things that being responsible stands
for and thus I believe this is an extremely important core value to have.

## Learning

How can one make any progress in life if there's no willingness to learn? A
very important value to me is learning. Outside of the computer world, I
love learning about different cultural traditions and languages. For
instance, did you know that in Korea it's a sign of respect to hand things
over to other people using two hands?

# My Application to Outreachy

## Outreachy

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org) is a program that organizes 3-month-long internships in [Free/Libre
Open Software(FLOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) projects for underrepresented groups in the tech
industry. There are opportunities not only for programming but also design,
improving documentation, and whatnot.

I remember the first time I heard about Outreachy was when I entered
college. There was this sort of one-week-long event meant to introduce
undergraduate freshmen to opportunities in and out of college. The Outreachy
Program was mentioned along with it, and since then I've been wanting to be
part of it.

This year, I got to know better about FLOSS through the undergraduate
research I'm part of. I learned about the basics, like licensing, how these
communities communicate, and how this kind of software is built. For
instance, I had no clue that the development of software could be done
using mailing lists. And before Outreachy, I had never used [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) before, nor
ever used email to send patches ~~I had never even made a patch~~.

Anyway, what motivated me to apply to Outreachy was that I wanted to see
with my own eyes how a free software community works and what it's like to
be part of one. Besides that, I was also very motivated  by my undergraduate
research group.

## GNU Guix

During the initial application process, [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/en/) projects caught my eyes because
the language used was [Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile). Coincidence or not, it was the language used
in one of my college subjects - Fundamental Concepts in Programming
Languages. I had liked it, so I thought it could be a good opportunity to
see Scheme in practice and also learn more about it.

Guix is described as an "advanced distribution of the GNU operating system",
but you can also use it as a package manager on top of a foreign distro. I
use it along with Ubuntu. For my internship, I'll add a subcommand to see
the history of all packages, making it easier to browse through different
package versions.
