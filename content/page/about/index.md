你好！

The exercise of writing this 'about' page and thinking about who I am took
quite some time. I guess I could start off by saying my name is Magali, and I'm
a Computer Science student. I like learning about {natural, programming}
languages. I'm also interested in operating systems and open source
technologies -- on that note, check [some of my contributions to the Linux kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=Magali).

As for other things I do in my free time, I really enjoy watching Korean and
Chinese dramas, listening to pop music, hanging out when it's super sunny, and,
last but definitely not least, keeping my Duolingo streak intact.
