Future Magali,

you will, most likely, have forgotten how to run your own blog, so here it goes.

Clone this repo, but don't forget to clone it recursively, since the blog theme
is a submodule.

`git clone --recurse-submodules <this_repo_url>`

If you want to see drafts:

`hugo server -D`

Otherwise, run:

`hugo server`

Cheers,
Past Magali who also forgot how to run this.
