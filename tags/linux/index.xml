Apart from finding something to fix yourself, an alternative is to look at what automated bots designed to look for bugs and warnings in the kernel have already found1. One of these bots is the kernel test robot2, and an advantage of going through the warnings found by this bot is that it provides the ways to reproduce the settings that led to the compilation warnings.</description></item></channel></rss>
